# textile-gui
Web frontend for querying and interacting with [Textile](https://www.textile.io/) threads and buckets. Aiming to make a simple management interface without needing to use the CLI.

#### Project Stage: Alpha

## Get Started

1. Visit: https://the-digital-labs.github.io/textile-gui/index.html

2. Click on the settings icon in the bottom left. Input your Textile API key + secret and click "save". Your information is saved in your localstorage, we do not collect or send your keys anywhere. The whole app is fully client-side.

For information on how to create a Textile account and get your API keys, visit: https://docs.textile.io/hub/apis/

### Dev Setup
